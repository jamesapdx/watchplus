Perfect for testing and validation! Run tests, review the results, and send your recordings to the developers. Watch that memory leak grow!

Handy for troubleshooting, sometimes you just need to see it in action, and then rewind and see it again!

Great for system monitoring, let a command run, then come back later and rewind through the results. Makes it easy to figure out which process is the troublemaker.

Python 2 and 3 compatible. Features a single program file for ease of distribution.
